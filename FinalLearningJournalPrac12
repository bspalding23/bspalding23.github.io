Content Insights:
-	Not too much learnt so much this practical. Most of our work is just polishing up our work and filling in the content for our website. 
-	Presentation however was good to collaborate and firstly practice our speech, but also change and issues and get good feedback from Lindsay.
-	This project overall has been really insight. This is the first time I’ve had to build a custom theme. It’s interesting to see how easy it can be to implement a static HTML and CSS into a dynamic theme using PHP. 
-	Also, I found the staging and production implementation good. Knowing how to create a link between pushing from your local environment, to updating your website is valuable information.

Career/Employability/Learning Insight:
-	I have done small projects at my work regarding software development, and this is spot on to how a business process handles it. It was good to exposure to this during my degree as it’s invaluable experience.
-	This is the first time properly using Trello which is also good because I know at work, they rely on it for them collaborating tools during Sprints.
-	I think overall the project is exactly what a business scenario would be. However, more professionally executed.
-	Also refining my HTML, CSS and learning PHP and to make dynamic themes is very good for a career point of view as it’s some of the most use languages in the industry.
