Content Insights:
- I have never used Content Management Systems. So I learned about them and how good they are.
I could not believe how easy it was to build a basic functioning website using a CMS as oppose to coding everything yourself.
Having most of it automated helped a lot with the scaling and structure of the webpages.
- It is a good learning curve as I can use a CMS to build something polished very fast, then inspect the webpage and look at
HTML code and see how it is done.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
- Being able to learn how CMS's work and how to use them is very beneficial if you were wanting to go down this career.
I am sure CMS would be used throughout businesses everywhere as it makes designing a lot easier and effecient.
