Content Insights:
- I thought using a differe Content Management System would be very easy. However it was quite different so I found it a little difficult
to begin with. after though, it was pretty easy to replicate the website from Joomla.
- Learning to use plugins and extensions are good, as well as preloaded layouts.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
- I think learning to use different CMS's and showcase how you can replicate websites with different ones
shows good skills for career opportunities.
