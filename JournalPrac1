Week:
Week 2 Practical 1

Learning Activities
-	Completed most of Introduction to Web Design and Development.
-	Completed Practical Basic Web Design

Resources/Links:
-	Did not realise till after I done practical (Done it before Thursday session) that we are not meant to be building it all ourselves and to use templates.

Estimate Hours:
-	2 Hours

Content Insights:
-	I relearned about HTML and CSS and how HTML makes the content and CSS is the style. Also, JS is the functionality. 
-	After attending the external session. I realised we are not meant to be coding from scratch and now we are learning to using resources available to us to help make faster systems so we can make more professional project efficiently. I did not realise that and already completed this practical, so will using templates, etc. Moving forwards

Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
-	I found that the learning activities (Video for practicals) is quite lengthy, and I work full time and do four subjects. So, skimming through important information of them and practicing between seems to be more effective. This way I also do not burn myself out by doing hours and hours of content for each subject outside of work.
