Content Insights:
- It is actually really cool to set up a localhost using online software. It was extremely easy. I like it because I can use this to work on my assignments when I am 
travelling somewhere as I don't need internet. It also loads a lot faster at home with it being local.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
- I would choose to do this over a Web one because of how easy it is to create and how easy it is to deploy
